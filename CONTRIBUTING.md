# Contributing

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Mobile Verification Toolkit (MVT)! Your help is very much appreciated.


## Where to start

Starting to contribute to a somewhat complex project like MVT might seem intimidating. Unless you have specific ideas of new functionality you would like to submit, some good starting points are searching for `TODO:` and `FIXME:` comments throughout the code. Alternatively you can check if any GitHub issues existed marked with the ["help wanted"](https://github.com/mvt-project/mvt/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22help+wanted%22) tag.


## Code style

When contributing code to 

- **Indentation**: we use 4-spaces tabs.

- **Quotes**: we use double quotes (`"`) as a default. Single quotes (`'`) can be favored with nested strings instead of escaping (`\"`), or e.g. using using f-formatting.

- **Maximum line length**: we strongly encourage to respect a 80 characters long lines and to follow [PEP8 indentation guidelines](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/#indentation) when having to wrap. However, if breaking at 80 is not possible or is detrimental to the readability of the code, exceptions are tolerated so long as they remain within a hard maximum length of 100 characters.
